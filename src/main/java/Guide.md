# Java 21 Certification Preparation Guide

This document is a guide through the files in this repository and a suggested path for preparing for the **OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 21 Developer (Exam 1Z0-830)** certification.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Read the book**  
   *OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 21 Developer Study Guide: Exam 1Z0-830*  
   Authors: Jeanne Boyarsky & Scott Selikoff

   This book contains crucial information about the Java 21 certification, including concepts that developers may not frequently use in day-to-day work.

2. **Do the foundation tests** in the Enthuware application  
   These will help you build your core understanding.

3. **Read the [Notes.md](Notes.md)** file  
   It contains many important points, but it’s highly recommended that you **create your own notes**, focusing on topics where you feel less confident.

4. **Attempt tests 1, 2, and 3** in Enthuware
    - Aim for a score between **60–80%**.
    - If you fall short, take notes on your mistakes, review the topics, and retry.

5. **Attempt tests 4, 5, and 6**, then **repeat tests 4, 5, and 6**
    - Again, aim for 60–80%.
    - Review missed questions thoroughly before moving on.

6. **Continue this process** until you reach **test 16**, or until you feel confident enough to move to the next step.

7. **Take the hard test**
    - Create your own custom test with these 70 questions: [enthuware-hard-test.md](questions/enthuware-hard-test.md).
    - Complete it in **2 hours**.
    - It’s challenging — that’s the point.

8. **Deep-dive into hard questions**
    - Go to my blog: https://devjava.substack.com/ and search for the Java 21 certification. You will find some good questions. All the code is available here: [hard questions folder](questions/hard).
    - Fell free to look at the [practical](questions/practical) as well.

9. **Read the ExtraNotes**
    - The [ExtraNotes.md](ExtraNotes.md) contains valuable information that can help you during the test.

10. **Do the unique tests**
    - Aim for at least **70%**.
    - If you hit that mark, there’s a great chance you’ll **ace the real exam**.

## The Real Exam

- The exam includes **long, complex questions** that can take over 5 minutes to solve.  
  It’s often best to **skip these initially** and answer the faster questions first (some take only 1 minute).  
  This will help you build confidence and leave time to come back to the longer ones.

- The exam platform includes a **basic notepad** for taking notes or doing calculations.  
  It’s not great, but it’s helpful for certain problems.

- You will take the exam using **specialized proctoring software**.  
  Make sure you have a **stable, high-speed internet connection** — any disconnection can interrupt your test.

## Final Words

- Expect **time pressure** — some questions are intentionally long.
- **Enjoy the process** — it’s a great opportunity to strengthen your Java skills.
